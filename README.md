Final project - Music Collection Inventory

Objective of the project:
  Create a python project using OO Principles along with Tkinter as the GUI.
  The project will be a Music Collection Inventory. It will come with some
  default data but the user can add/edit/delete as they choose. 
  Two important features of this project is the CRUD system that allows the
  user to make changes and that the data is stored in a relational database.

The Data:
  The data is stored in an included database called MusicInventory.db. It is
  a Sqlite3 database but could easily be converted to MySQL or something else.
  The database contains four tables, Album, Artist, Genre and Media.

The User Interface:
  The user interface is built with Tkinter. Some of the out of the ordinary
  features are; tool tips, dynamic showing and hiding of buttons, dropdown
  boxes for adds and updates and online imaging. The online imaging was put
  in place so that when you add a new album you do not have to download the
  album cover image. You can just put in a URL that points to the 
  image and store that in the record. When the record is viewed, your image
  will be downloaded from the Internet and displayed.
